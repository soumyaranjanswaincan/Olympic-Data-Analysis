# Project title: Analysis of Olympic Games

## Main question: What are the key factors influencing Olympic medal outcomes?

### Sub questions: 
- Hosting countries has impact to the country's performance? 
- Season has impact to the country's performance?
- Age, sex, heigh has impact to the performance?

##### A brief summary about the main dataset(s):
Kaggle: 120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results 

##### Data preparation: 
- check NAN value and replace them with mean
- create a column for hosting country based on the "city" information
- replace the name of country becuase some countries change its name overtimee 

##### Summary of major findings and conclusions
- Hosting countries tend to perform better/won more medals
- Some countries are better at winter games 
- Age, weight and height have some impact to the Olympic performance

##### Our code:
It can be divided into 2 parts: 
1. The data preparation code: Data_cleanup.ipynb
    The clean data is saved as Clean_data.csv
2. The analysis is divided into 2 parts:
    country: country_performance.ipynb
    athlete: athlete.ipynb

Packages that need to be installed to run the code. The following modules are used for the code: 
matplotlib.pyplot, pandas, geopandas, plotly.express,numpy, request, time, scipy.stats (linregress), datatime, ipywidgets (interact)

##### Limitations and Assumptions
- Medal counts: The data from Kaggle is based on the participation of each athlete. For a group compeititon, the data has entry for each athelete who participates the game. As a result, the medal counts based on each country is overstated if it wins medals for group compeitions.
